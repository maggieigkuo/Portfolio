# Maggie Kuo's Portfolio
## About Me
Hi, I’m Maggie Kuo! A recent Binghamton graduate who majored in Integrative Neuroscience with a Digital and Data Studies minor. With an extensive background in research and an eye for problem-solving, I am passionate about exploring how technology and data influence human biases, perception, and decision-making. My interdisciplinary education allows me to approach problems with a blend of scientific rigor and data-driven analysis. I aim to drive meaningful change in how we deliver and manage care in an increasingly tech-driven world. Given the opportunity, I am eager to apply my skills to the data science field as an entry-level data specialist, focusing on behavioral/consumer analysis. 

I have gained valuable skills in Python, Tableau, R, SQL, JavaScript, CSS/HTML allowing me to conduct statistical analysis, perform data visualizations, and grasp a deeper understanding of pattern and trends. 

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills and the projects I have completed so far.

## Projects

### Python

### Analyzing Stop and Frisks Occurring in each NYC Borough

Code: [View Code](https://github.com/maggieigkuo/Portfolio/blob/main/Stop_and_Frisk.ipynb)

Goal: Assess ways to decrease or, ideally, end racial disparities that occur during stop-and-frisk searches in New York City.

Description: The objective of this project was to analyze the 2023 NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset. In a group of 3, we examined over 50 columns, narrowed them down to 18, and developed four research questions to identify any alarming trends or patterns occurring during stop-and-frisk incidents. The dataset required extensive cleaning, as there were many NaNs and null values across multiple columns. The analysis incorporated logistic regressions, mapping, and data visualization. 

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, regression analysis, data visualization

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels.api, GeoPandas

Results: From the analysis, Black male Americans in the Bronx and Brooklyn are more likely to be stopped and frisked, with many of the consensual cases leading to physical (verbal) escalations. The number of arrests increased when a supervisor checked an officer's logs, demonstrating a statistically significant relationship between arrests and supervisory oversight.

### Social Media Data Visualization Analysis

Code: [View Code](https://github.com/maggieigkuo/Portfolio/blob/main/Social_Media_Data_Visualization.ipynb)

Goal: Produce six visualizations from the data to identify key patterns and trends, effectively conveying a clear narrative about what the data reveals and its implications

Description: This dataset encompasses various age groups, genders, sexual orientations, and emotions across different social media platforms. The purpose of the project is to create visualizations that uncover significant correlations among these factors and provide meaningful insights into the results. 

Skills: data analysis, data visualization

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

Results: Social media significantly impacts female users more than male and non-binary individuals. Platforms like Instagram have evolved into culturally powerful tools, capable of influencing a person's mood and shaping their self-image.

### Tableau

### Global Maternal Mortality

Dashboard: [View Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maggie.kuo/viz/FinalProjectDash1_17465960340370/Dashboard1) <br>
Presentation: [View Presentation](https://github.com/maggieigkuo/Portfolio/blob/main/Maternal%20Mortality.pdf) <br>
Final Report: [View Report](https://github.com/maggieigkuo/Portfolio/blob/main/Global%20Maternal%20Mortality%20Final%20Report.pdf)

Goal: Produce 2 dashboards with at least 3 visualizations to compare maternal health outcomes across countries with the highest and lowest Gross National Income (GNI) 

Description: For this final project we researched and analyzed the global maternal mortality rates, focusing on countries with the highest GNI per capita versus countries with the lowest GNI capita. We felt that maternal mortality is a topic that is underrepresented in the media, and there have been many global events that have happened since the 2000s that affect maternal mortality rates. It is important for us to further understand and analyze some contributing factors as to why there is an increase or decrease in these mortality rates, and utilize this information when creating visualizations so they are accessible for the public to be more informed.

Research Questions: 
1. How does the economic status of a country influence how often skilled healthcare workers are in attendance during child birth? 
2. What are the leading causes of maternal mortality in low-income vs. high-income countries? 
3. How has maternal mortality rates changed over the last two decades?

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, large datasets, research, trend analysis

Technology: Tableau, Excel

Results: Although there has been a steady decrease in global maternal mortality within the last few decades, maternal deaths are occurring at higher rates in low GNI countries. The presence of skilled healthcare workers during childbirth is significant in reducing maternal mortality and producing better health outcomes. 

### Exploring Chicago's Demographic Landscape

Dashboard: [View Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maggie.kuo/viz/ChicagosDemographic2014/Dashboard1)

Goal: Produce a dashboard with at least 3 visualizations to tell a meaningful story about the future prospects of young teens in Chicago by examining how their opportunities may differ based on where they live.  

Description: This dashboard investigates how place-based inequalities in Chicago shape the life outcomes of young people, particularly in predominantly Black communities, in the year 2014. Using geographic data, the project visualizes teen birth rates, college graduation rates by gender, and the relationship between child poverty and opportunity. Through thoughtful visual design and ethical storytelling, the dashboard emphasizes how systemic disparities in healthcare, education, and neighborhood resources affect youth opportunity and highlights the need for targeted policy attention in underserved areas.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, accessibility, research

Technology: Tableau, Excel

Results: Teen birth rates were highest in predominantly Black neighborhoods, suggesting limited access to reproductive healthcare and broader health equity. Educational analysis showed that women consistently graduate at higher rates than men, yet this achievement alone doesn't offset systemic barriers faced by marginalized groups. Lastly, a strong negative correlation was observed between child poverty and opportunity—communities with higher rates of poverty had significantly lower Childhood Opportunity Index scores. 

### R

Final Report: [View Report](https://github.com/maggieigkuo/Portfolio/blob/main/FHAB%20Research%20Report.pdf)

Goal: Develop a public-facing dashboard for Binghamton’s Fair Housing Advisory Board to be featured on their website, empowering future tenants with accessible insights into the city’s most frequently cited landlords

Description: In partnership with Binghamton’s Fair Housing Advisory Board (FHAB), this project investigates patterns of landlord misconduct, eviction filings, and housing code violations across Broome County using FOIL-obtained data. The goal was to develop a public dashboard that visualizes properties owned by the city's most frequently cited landlords, offering tenants an accessible tool to make informed housing decisions. By consolidating fragmented datasets, cleaning and geocoding over 390 properties, and creating interactive maps and charts, the project sheds light on structural inequalities in Binghamton’s rental market and supports community efforts to promote transparency, tenant rights, and policy reform.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, large datasets, trend analysis, 

Technology: R, Excel, Python

Results: Key findings revealed that eviction filings and housing complaints are highly concentrated among a small number of landlords—particularly figures like Ritter and the Binghamton Housing Authority—who were responsible for the majority of court-recorded evictions between 2022 and 2024. Geographic analysis exposed clusters of complaint-prone properties in central Binghamton, highlighting localized areas of housing instability. The dashboard allows users to explore landlord profiles, eviction history, and code violations, helping tenants identify high-risk properties.
