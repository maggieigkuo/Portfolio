# Maggie Kuo's Portfolio
## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Maggie Kuo! A current senior majoring in Integrative Neuroscience with a Digital and Data Studies minor. With an extensive background in research and an eye for problem-solving, I am passionate about exploring how technology and data influence human biases, perception, and decision-making. My interdisciplinary education allows me to approach problems with a blend of scientific rigor and data-driven analysis. I aim to drive meaningful change in how we deliver and manage care in an increasingly tech-driven world. Given the opportunity, I am eager to apply my skills to the data science field as an entry-level data specialist. 

As I continue to finish my studies, I have gained valuable skills in Python conducting statistical analysis, data visualization, and analysis of pattern and trends. I plan on adding more skills to my toolkit by learning Tableu, SQL, HTML, and R by the end of the spring. 

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills and the projects I have completed so far.

This section will be used to briefly describe the data analytics projects (in Python) done to solve stalkeholder cases.

### Analyzing Stop and Frisks Occurring in each NYC Borough

Code: https://github.com/maggieigkuo/Portfolio/blob/main/Stop_and_Frisk.ipynb

Goal: Assess ways to decrease or, ideally, end racial disparities that occur during stop-and-frisk searches in New York City.

Description: This project's objective was analyzing the 2023 NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset. We had to examine over 50 columns in the dataset, narrow it down to 18, and then create four research questions to find any alarming trends or patterns that occurs during a stop-and-frisk. This dataset required extensive data cleaning as there was many NANs and nulls within each column. The questions incorporated logitistic regressions, mapping, and data visualization. 

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, regression analysis, data visualization

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels.api, GeoPandas

Results: From the analysis, Black, male Americans in the Bronx and Brookly are more to be stopped and frisked, with many of the consensual cases leading to physical (verbal) escalations. The number of arrests increased when a supervisor checked the logs of an officer, proving statistical significance between arrests and supervisor interference.
