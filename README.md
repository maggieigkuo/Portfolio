# Maggie Kuo's Portfolio
## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Maggie Kuo! A recent Binghamton graduate who majored in Integrative Neuroscience with a Digital and Data Studies minor. With an extensive background in research and an eye for problem-solving, I am passionate about exploring how technology and data influence human biases, perception, and decision-making. My interdisciplinary education allows me to approach problems with a blend of scientific rigor and data-driven analysis. I aim to drive meaningful change in how we deliver and manage care in an increasingly tech-driven world. Given the opportunity, I am eager to apply my skills to the data science field as an entry-level data specialist, focusing on behavioral/consumer analysis. 

I have gained valuable skills in Python, Tableau, SQL, CSS/HTML allowing me to conduct statistical analysis, perform data visualizations, and grasp a deeper understanding of pattern and trends. 

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills and the projects I have completed so far.

## Projects
This section will be used to briefly describe the data analytics projects done to solve stalkeholder cases.

### Analyzing Stop and Frisks Occurring in each NYC Borough

Code: https://github.com/maggieigkuo/Portfolio/blob/main/Stop_and_Frisk.ipynb

Goal: Assess ways to decrease or, ideally, end racial disparities that occur during stop-and-frisk searches in New York City.

Description: The objective of this project was to analyze the 2023 NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset. In a group of 3, we examined over 50 columns, narrowed them down to 18, and developed four research questions to identify any alarming trends or patterns occurring during stop-and-frisk incidents. The dataset required extensive cleaning, as there were many NaNs and null values across multiple columns. The analysis incorporated logistic regressions, mapping, and data visualization. 

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, regression analysis, data visualization

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels.api, GeoPandas

Results: From the analysis, Black male Americans in the Bronx and Brooklyn are more likely to be stopped and frisked, with many of the consensual cases leading to physical (verbal) escalations. The number of arrests increased when a supervisor checked an officer's logs, demonstrating a statistically significant relationship between arrests and supervisory oversight.

### Social Media Data Visualization Analysis

Code: https://github.com/maggieigkuo/Portfolio/blob/main/Social_Media_Data_Visualization.ipynb

Goal: Produce six visualizations from the data to identify key patterns and trends, effectively conveying a clear narrative about what the data reveals and its implications

Description: This dataset encompasses various age groups, genders, sexual orientations, and emotions across different social media platforms. The purpose of the project is to create visualizations that uncover significant correlations among these factors and provide meaningful insights into the results. 

Skills: data analysis, data visualization

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

Results: Social media significantly impacts female users more than male and non-binary individuals. Platforms like Instagram have evolved into culturally powerful tools, capable of influencing a person's mood and shaping their self-image.

### Global Maternal Mortality

Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maggie.kuo/viz/FinalProjectDash1_17465960340370/Dashboard1

Goal: Produce 2 dashboards with at least 3 visualizations to compare maternal health outcomes across countries with the highest and lowest Gross National Income (GNI) 

Description: For this final project we researched and analyzed the global maternal mortality rates, focusing on countries with the highest GNI per capita versus countries with the lowest GNI capita. We felt that maternal mortality is a topic that is underrepresented in the media, and there have been many global events that have happened since the 2000s that affect maternal mortality rates. It is important for us to further understand and analyze some contributing factors as to why there is an increase or decrease in these mortality rates, and utilize this information when creating visualizations so they are accessible for the public to be more informed.

Research Questions: 
1. How does the economic status of a country influence how often skilled healthcare workers are in attendance during child birth? 
2. What are the leading causes of maternal mortality in low-income vs. high-income countries? 
3. How has maternal mortality rates changed over the last two decades?

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, large datasets

Technology: Tableau, Excel

Results: Although there has been a steady decrease in global maternal mortality within the last few decades, maternal deaths are occurring at higher rates in low GNI countries. The presence of skilled healthcare workers during childbirth is significant in reducing maternal mortality and producing better health outcomes.
