## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Maggie Kuo! A current senior majoring in Integrative Neuroscience with a Digital and Data Studies minor. With an extensive background in research and an eye for problem-solving, I am passionate about exploring how technology and data influence human biases, perception, and decision-making. My interdisciplinary education allows me to approach problems with a blend of scientific rigor and data-driven analysis. I aim to drive meaningful change in how we deliver and manage care in an increasingly tech-driven world. Given the opportunity, I am eager to apply my skills to the data science field as an entry-level data specialist. 

As I continue to finish my studies, I have gained valuable skills in Python conducting statistical analysis, data visualization, and analysis of pattern and trends. I plan on adding more skills to my toolkit by learning Tableu, SQL, HTML, and R by the end of the spring. 

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills and the projects I have completed so far.
